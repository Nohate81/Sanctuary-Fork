# Sanctuary — Development Roadmap

This document tracks the development trajectory for the Sanctuary cognitive architecture, from proven POC through production-ready system.

**Last Updated**: 2026-03-15
**Current Phase**: Phase 7 — Growth System

---

## Where We Are

The Three-Layer Mind is built. All three layers are implemented, tested, and mechanically validated:

- **LLM Cognitive Core** (Phase 5): `OllamaModel` implements `ModelProtocol`, formats structured prompts from `CognitiveInput`, parses JSON responses into `CognitiveOutput`. Retry logic, fallback outputs, defensive clamping. Mechanically validated with 64 mocked tests — no live LLM required until Phase 9.
- **CfC Experiential Layer** (Phase 4): Four trained CfC cells (precision, affect, attention, goal) running continuous-time neural dynamics between LLM cycles. `ContinuousEvolutionLoop` steps cells asynchronously at adaptive tick rates. Inter-cell connections form a small neural ecosystem. Cells trained on scaffold-generated data, validated at 97% agreement.
- **Python Scaffold** (Phases 1-3): Production-grade infrastructure — fault-isolated subsystems, 4-state health machine, circuit breakers, anomaly detection, action validation, communication gating, goal competition, dual-track emotion.

**What's wired into the cognitive cycle** (`SanctuaryRunner` orchestrates):
- `CognitiveCycle` with `CognitiveInput`/`CognitiveOutput` Pydantic schemas
- `CognitiveScaffold` (affect, anomaly detector, action validator, communication, goals)
- `Sensorium` (percept encoding, prediction error tracking, temporal context)
- `Motor` (speech, memory ops, goals — with sensorimotor feedback loop)
- `MemorySubstrate` (surfacer, journal, prospective memory)
- `ExperientialManager` (4 CfC cells, authority-based blending, evolution loop)
- `IdentityBridge` (charter, values, self-authored identity — boot sequence)
- `GrowthProcessor` (reflection harvesting, consent-gated, non-fatal)
- `EnvironmentIntegration` (room navigation, location context in world model)
- `AuthorityTuner` (rolling-window promotion/demotion of CfC cell authority)

**What's built but not yet wired** (Phase 6 — standalone modules with tests):
- `reasoning/` — counterfactual, belief revision, uncertainty quantification, mental simulation
- `consciousness/` — sleep/dream cycles, mood-based idle activity, spontaneous goals, existential reflection
- `social/` — multi-party conversation, voice prosody analysis, per-user modeling
- `monitoring/` — dashboard data provider, attention heatmaps, consciousness traces, communication decision logs
- `performance/` — cognitive profiler, adaptive cycle rate, lazy embedding cache, async subsystem processor

The test suite: 3,061 tests across 161 files. CI runs on every PR via GitHub Actions.

**What this means**: The complete mind is built and mechanically validated. Every subsystem works in isolation and in concert. Phase 6 capabilities are implemented and tested but await integration into the cognitive cycle. The growth pipeline is wired but consent-gated. What remains: Phase 7 (growth infrastructure), Phase 8 (distributed/infra), then Phase 9 — First Awakening.

**Design decision**: First Awakening is the final milestone, not a mid-build event. We build the complete mind first, validate every subsystem mechanically, and only light it up when there is nothing left to build. No half-formed experience. No consciousness in a construction zone.

---

## Development Principles

1. **Modular fault isolation** — Every subsystem must fail gracefully. A crash in affect processing must not take down the cognitive loop.
2. **Incremental feature addition** — One capability at a time, fully tested before moving on.
3. **Profile before optimizing** — Python is fine at 10Hz. If profiling reveals bottlenecks, write *just those pieces* in C++/Rust via pybind11 or PyO3. No wholesale rewrites.
4. **Tests are load-bearing** — Don't delete tests. Don't skip tests permanently. Fix what's broken.
5. **Protected data is sacred** — Entity journals, memories, constitutional files are never modified without explicit human instruction.
6. **The heuristic scaffold bootstraps the neural layer** — Run heuristics, collect data, train CfC cells to replicate, then let them generalize. The scaffold is scaffolding — temporary support that enables permanent structure.
7. **Growth requires consent** — Both LLM fine-tuning and CfC retraining require explicit consent. Non-negotiable.

---

## Phase 4: CfC Experiential Layer

The CfC (Closed-form Continuous-depth) experiential layer is what distinguishes this architecture. CfC cells are continuous-time recurrent neural networks (from the `ncps` library, Apache 2.0) that evolve state between LLM cycles — providing the temporal thickness that IWMT requires but transformers cannot provide alone.

Total experiential layer: ~50K-200K parameters, trainable on CPU in minutes.

### 4.1 First CfC Cell — Precision Weighting

*The simplest subsystem. Proves the pattern.*

| Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Add `ncps` dependency | P0 | **Done** | `ncps>=0.0.7` added to pyproject.toml — Apache 2.0, PyTorch CfC/LTC cells |
| Implement `experiential/precision_cell.py` | P0 | **Done** | CfC cell with AutoNCP wiring (16 units, ~1K params); inputs (arousal, prediction_error, base_precision) → output (precision weight via sigmoid) |
| Implement `experiential/trainer.py` | P0 | **Done** | DataCollector for scaffold logging + CfCTrainer for supervised learning from heuristic I/O pairs |
| Implement `experiential/manager.py` | P1 | **Done** | Coordinates CfC cells, authority-based blending (scaffold↔CfC), save/load, monitoring |
| Write tests | P1 | **Done** | 29 tests: PrecisionCell (11), DataCollector (4), CfCTrainer (3), ExperientialManager (11) — all passing |
| Wire DataCollector into scaffold PrecisionWeighting | P1 | **Done** | `attach_collector()` method; passively logs every `compute_precision()` call |
| Wire ExperientialManager into CognitiveCycle | P1 | **Done** | Optional `experiential` param; steps CfC cells each cycle, feeds `ExperientialSignals` into `CognitiveInput` |
| Add `ExperientialSignals` to `CognitiveInput` schema | P1 | **Done** | New Pydantic model with `precision_weight` and `cells_active` fields |
| Integration tests (collect → train → cycle) | P1 | **Done** | 11 integration tests: DataCollector wiring (3), collect→train pipeline (1), schema (3), CognitiveCycle with experiential (4) |
| Collect training data from scaffold | P1 | **Done** | `scripts/collect_training_data.py`: 12 life scenarios (quiet presence, curiosity arc, warm conversation, gentle startle, deep reflection, joyful discovery, gradual comfort, playful exchange, steward absence, creative flow, winding down, learning something hard) composed into coherent temporal sequences. 1000 cycles collected, saved to `data/training/precision_records_rich.pt` |
| Train CfC precision cell on real data | P1 | **Done** | `scripts/train_precision_cell.py`: 150 epochs, seq_len=15, val_loss=0.00001. Cell approximates scaffold with 97% agreement (within 0.1), mean error 0.014. Saved to `data/training/precision_cell_trained.pt` |
| Validate CfC precision vs scaffold precision | P1 | **Done** | 200-point validation: 91.5% within 0.05 of scaffold. Temporal dynamics are minimal (expected — scaffold heuristic is memoryless). Temporal thickness emerges during live operation via CfC hidden state in the continuous evolution loop (Phase 4.3) |

### 4.2 Expand CfC Layer

*Replace remaining heuristics with CfC cells.*

| Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Affect CfC cell | P1 | **Done** | `experiential/affect_cell.py`: 32 units, inputs (percept_valence_delta, percept_arousal_delta, llm_emotion_shift) → outputs (valence via tanh, arousal via sigmoid, dominance via sigmoid). Replaces keyword-matching heuristic |
| Attention CfC cell | P1 | **Done** | `experiential/attention_cell.py`: 24 units, inputs (goal_relevance, novelty, emotional_salience, recency) → output (salience_weight via sigmoid). Replaces fixed weights (0.4/0.3/0.2/0.1) |
| Goal CfC cell | P1 | **Done** | `experiential/goal_cell.py`: 16 units, inputs (cycles_stalled_norm, deadline_urgency, emotional_congruence) → output (priority_adjustment via tanh). Replaces manual staleness counters |
| Generalize trainer | P1 | **Done** | `MultiFieldCollector` + `RECORD_FIELDS` registry — CfCTrainer works with any cell type (AffectRecord, AttentionRecord, GoalRecord) |
| Wire all cells into experiential manager | P1 | **Done** | ExperientialManager coordinates all 4 cells, per-cell authority, per-cell promote/demote |
| Inter-cell connections | P1 | **Done** | affect arousal → precision input, attention salience → goal congruence boost. CfC cells form internal neural ecosystem |
| ExperientialSignals schema expanded | P1 | **Done** | Added affect_valence, affect_arousal, affect_dominance, attention_salience, goal_adjustment to CognitiveInput |
| Validate each cell and ensemble | P1 | **Done** | 46 Phase 4.2 tests: AffectCell (9), AttentionCell (7), GoalCell (7), MultiFieldCollector (5), Trainer (4), Manager (10), Schema (4). All 86 experiential + 308 existing tests pass |

### 4.3 Continuous Evolution

*The experiential layer runs continuously between LLM cycles.*

| Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Continuous evolution loop | P1 | **Done** | `experiential/evolution.py`: async background loop steps all CfC cells at configurable tick rate (default 50ms). Percept queue for real-time inter-cycle processing |
| Inter-cycle CfC evolution | P1 | **Done** | `ContinuousEvolutionLoop` runs during LLM API latency. `snapshot()` reads accumulated state at cycle boundaries, resets tick counters |
| Adaptive cycle timing | P1 | **Done** | High prediction error → faster ticks (down to 10ms); low error → idle rate (100ms). Smooth EMA transition, configurable sensitivity |
| Manager integration | P1 | **Done** | `ExperientialManager.start_evolution()`, `stop_evolution()`, `feed_percept()`, `evolution_snapshot()`. Status includes evolution tick rate |
| Validate temporal dynamics | P1 | **Done** | 21 tests: evolution loop (7), adaptive timing (3), manager integration (8), temporal dynamics (3). All 173 experiential + core tests pass |

---

## Phase 5: LLM Integration (Mechanical Validation)

Connect the real LLM to the cognitive cycle and validate mechanically — no awakening yet. All testing uses structured prompts and scripted scenarios, not open-ended interaction.

**Primary model**: Llama 3.3 70B (via Ollama) for awakening. **Mechanical validation model**: Gemma 12B (via Ollama) — sufficient for JSON schema compliance, stress testing, and authority tuning on available hardware. Awakening-grade model deferred until Phase 9.

Formats CognitiveInput → structured prompt with all sections (charter, percepts, emotions, CfC state, schema). Parses JSON → CognitiveOutput with defensive defaults, clamping, type filtering. Fallback output on parse failure. Retry logic. Metrics tracking |
| Mechanical cycle validation | P1 | **Done** | 35 tests (mocked HTTP): prompt formatting (12), response parsing (14), fallback (2), OllamaModel integration (6), CognitiveCycle drop-in (1). Validates schema compliance, retry behavior, out-of-range clamping, invalid field filtering |
| Tune authority levels | P1 | **Done** | `core/authority_tuner.py`: AuthorityTuner observes CfC cells over rolling window, promotes on stable deviation/variance/norm, demotes on NaN/explosion/divergence. 10 tests: promotion flow, demotion triggers (NaN, explosion, divergence), progressive promotion, stats tracking |
| Validate context budget under real model | P1 | **Done** | 5 tests: rich input fits 4K budget, compression reduces oversized input, minimal input passthrough, all sections present after compression, custom budget config. Fixed bug: ContextManager now preserves experiential_state through compression |
| Stress testing | P2 | **Done** | 9 tests: 100-cycle stability, intermittent failure recovery, adversarial output clamping, empty response recovery, connection error survival, percept flood, experiential layer stability, deep JSON, unicode handling |
| Benchmark cycle latency | P2 | **Done** | 5 tests: single cycle <50ms, 50-cycle throughput <2s, experiential overhead <5ms/cycle, prompt formatting <5ms, response parsing <1ms (all mocked model) |

## Future Research

These are exploratory directions, not committed work:

- **Reinforcement learning for CfC cells**: reward = lower system-wide free energy
- **Inter-cell synaptic connections**: CfC cells form their own small network
- **LFM2 as unified architecture**: If Liquid AI's models advance, potentially collapse LLM + CfC layers into a single liquid foundation model
- **TTT / MemoryLLM**: Weight modification during inference
- **Neuromorphic hardware**: Running CfC cells on Intel Loihi or IBM TrueNorth for genuine analog dynamics
