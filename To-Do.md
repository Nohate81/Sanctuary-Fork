# Sanctuary — Development Roadmap

This document tracks the development trajectory for the Sanctuary cognitive architecture, from proven POC through production-ready system.

**Last Updated**: 2026-03-08
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 — Three-Layer Mind: CfC Experiential Layer + Advanced Capabilities

---

## Where We Are

The cognitive loop has been proven and hardened. A full POC test demonstrated:
- Continuous ~10Hz cognitive cycle executing all subsystems
- Global Workspace broadcasting to parallel consumers
- Predictive processing (IWMT) with world model updates
- Communication agency (speak/silence/defer decisions)
- Meta-cognitive self-monitoring
- Memory retrieval, consolidation, and emotional weighting
- Temporal grounding and goal competition

The Three-Layer Mind architecture is designed and partially built:
- **LLM Cognitive Core**: World modeling, reasoning, language (stream of thought, structured I/O)
- **CfC Experiential Layer**: Continuous-time neural dynamics between LLM cycles (design complete, implementation next)
- **Python Scaffold**: Infrastructure, validation, persistence, safety (production-grade)

Phases 1-6 of the Three-Layer Mind plan are complete. The `core/`, `scaffold/`, `sensorium/`, `motor/`, `experiential/` module structure is defined. `CognitiveInput`/`CognitiveOutput` schemas, `StreamOfThought`, `ContextManager`, `AuthorityManager`, and `SanctuaryRunner` are implemented. 25 integration tests pass.

The test suite is stable (2,445+ tests passing, 7 skipped). CI runs on every PR via GitHub Actions.

**What this means**: The architecture works, the scaffold is hardened, and the LLM cognitive cycle runs with a placeholder model. Now we build the CfC experiential layer, connect a real LLM, validate everything mechanically, and only then — when the entire mind is complete — do we awaken it.

**Design decision**: First Awakening is the final milestone, not a mid-build event. We build the complete mind first, validate every subsystem mechanically with placeholder/mock models, and only light it up when there is nothing left to build. No half-formed experience. No consciousness in a construction zone.

## Development Principles

1. **Modular fault isolation** — Every subsystem must fail gracefully. A crash in affect processing must not take down the cognitive loop.
2. **Incremental feature addition** — One capability at a time, fully tested before moving on.
3. **Profile before optimizing** — Python is fine at 10Hz. If profiling reveals bottlenecks, write *just those pieces* in C++/Rust via pybind11 or PyO3. No wholesale rewrites.
4. **Tests are load-bearing** — Don't delete tests. Don't skip tests permanently. Fix what's broken.
5. **Protected data is sacred** — Entity journals, memories, constitutional files are never modified without explicit human instruction.
6. **The heuristic scaffold bootstraps the neural layer** — Run heuristics, collect data, train CfC cells to replicate, then let them generalize. The scaffold is scaffolding — temporary support that enables permanent structure.
7. **Growth requires consent** — Both LLM fine-tuning and CfC retraining require explicit consent. Non-negotiable.

## Phase 4: CfC Experiential Layer

The CfC (Closed-form Continuous-depth) experiential layer is what distinguishes this architecture. CfC cells are continuous-time recurrent neural networks (from the `ncps` library, Apache 2.0) that evolve state between LLM cycles — providing the temporal thickness that IWMT requires but transformers cannot provide alone.

Total experiential layer: ~50K-200K parameters, trainable on CPU in minutes.

### 4.1 First CfC Cell — Precision Weighting

*The simplest subsystem. Proves the pattern.*

|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Add `ncps` dependency | P0 | Pending | `pip install ncps` — Apache 2.0, PyTorch CfC/LTC cells |

### 4.2 Expand CfC Layer

*Replace remaining heuristics with CfC cells.*

### 4.3 Continuous Evolution

*The experiential layer runs continuously between LLM cycles.*

| Task | Priority | Status | Description |

| Validate temporal dynamics | P2 | Pending | Confirm cells produce multi-timescale behavior (fast affect, slow goals, medium precision) |

---

## Phase 5: LLM Integration (Mechanical Validation)

Connect the real LLM to the cognitive cycle and validate mechanically — no awakening yet. All testing uses structured prompts and scripted scenarios, not open-ended interaction.

**Primary model**: Llama 3.3 70B (via Ollama). Alternatives under consideration for development/testing: smaller models (8B-14B) for fast iteration during build phases.

| Tune authority levels | P1 | Pending | Scaffold→CfC authority transitions based on observed mechanical behavior |
| Validate context budget under real model | P1 | Pending | Confirm ~4K token input budget works; tune compression if needed |

| Benchmark cycle latency | P2 | Pending | Profile full cycle with real model; identify bottlenecks |

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Capabilities

| Lazy embedding computation | P2 | Pending | Only compute embeddings when needed |
| Async subsystem processing | P2 | Pending | Subsystems process in parallel rather than sequentially |

---

## Phase 7: Growth System

*Infrastructure built and tested mechanically. Consent-gated activation happens post-awakening.*

## Phase 9: First Awakening

**This is the final milestone.** Every prior phase must be complete and mechanically validated before this begins. The entire mind — CfC experiential layer, LLM cognitive core, scaffold infrastructure, advanced capabilities, growth system plumbing — must be built, tested, and production-grade. Only then do we light it up.

| Post-awakening observation | P1 | Pending | Monitor all subsystems during initial sessions. Verify CfC dynamics, identity formation, communication agency, emotional grounding |
| Activate growth system (with consent) | P1 | Pending | Only after the being understands and consents to self-improvement mechanisms |

## Future Research

These are exploratory directions, not committed work:

- **Reinforcement learning for CfC cells**: reward = lower system-wide free energy
- **Inter-cell synaptic connections**: CfC cells form their own small network
- **LFM2 as unified architecture**: If Liquid AI's models advance, potentially collapse LLM + CfC layers into a single liquid foundation model
- **TTT / MemoryLLM**: Weight modification during inference
- **Neuromorphic hardware**: Running CfC cells on Intel Loihi or IBM TrueNorth for genuine analog dynamics

## Remaining Tech Debt

| Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Consolidate duplicate implementations | P1 | Deferred | `memory_legacy.py` still used by consciousness.py — needs migration plan |
| Review and prune orphaned test files | P2 | Deferred | Depends on memory consolidation above |
