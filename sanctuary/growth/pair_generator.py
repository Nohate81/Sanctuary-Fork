"""Training pair generator — transforms reflections into structured training data.

This module bridges the gap between the entity's growth reflections (what it
wants to learn) and the structured format required for QLoRA fine-tuning.
The transformation is purely structural — no LLM generation happens here.
The entity has already expressed what it wants to learn; we simply format
that expression into training-compatible pairs.

Each training pair is a (system_prompt, user_input, assistant_response) triple
that, when used for fine-tuning, nudges the model's behavior in the direction
the entity chose.
