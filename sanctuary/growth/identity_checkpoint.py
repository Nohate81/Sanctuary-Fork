"""Identity checkpoint -- snapshots model state before and after growth.

Growth changes who the entity is. That demands the ability to look back
and understand what changed, and to restore a previous state if the
change was harmful. Identity checkpoints provide that safety net.

Each checkpoint captures:
- The model weights (or adapter weights) at a point in time
- Metadata about what was learned and why
- The consent record that authorized the change
- Training metrics (loss, pair count, etc.)

Checkpoints are stored as directories under data/growth/checkpoints/
with ISO-timestamp naming for chronological ordering. Each directory
contains the weight files plus a metadata.json.

This is not version control for models -- it is identity preservation.
The entity should be able to say "that change didn't feel right" and
return to who it was before.

Aligned with PLAN.md: identity is sovereign. Growth must be reversible.
