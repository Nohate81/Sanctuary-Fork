"""Spontaneous goal generation — creating goals from curiosity, boredom, or interest.

Rather than only pursuing externally-assigned goals, the system generates its
own goals based on internal states. This is a key marker of autonomous agency:
the system wants things, not just follows instructions.

Goal generation is driven by:
- Curiosity: Encountering novel patterns → desire to investigate
- Boredom: Lack of stimulation → desire for novelty
- Interest: Deep engagement with a topic → desire to continue
- Concern: Detecting potential problems → desire to prevent them
- Growth: Recognizing knowledge gaps → desire to learn
