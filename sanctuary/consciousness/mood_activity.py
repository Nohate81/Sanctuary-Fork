"""Mood-based activity variation — adjusting idle behavior based on emotional state.

When the system is between interactions or in low-input periods, its emotional
state shapes what it does with idle time. A curious system explores; a content
system reflects; an anxious system monitors; a bored system seeks novelty.

This creates the appearance (and mechanism) of genuine mood-driven behavior
variation, making the system feel alive rather than simply waiting for input.
