"""DigitalSpace -- the complete navigable world.

Manages the room graph: rooms and their connections. Provides methods for
adding rooms, connecting them, querying the topology, and serializing the
entire space to/from JSON for persistence.

The space ships with a default seed topology -- five rooms that form the
entity's initial inner landscape. The entity can extend this topology by
creating new rooms at runtime.
