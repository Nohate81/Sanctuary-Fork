"""
Broadcast Integration for Cognitive Core.

This module integrates the broadcast system into the existing cognitive architecture.
It provides a BroadcastCoordinator that manages broadcast consumers and coordinates
workspace broadcasts with the existing subsystems.

    Coordinates broadcast integration with cognitive subsystems.
    
    This class acts as a bridge between the new broadcast system and
    the existing cognitive architecture. It manages broadcast consumers
    and provides methods to broadcast workspace updates.
    
    Key Features:
    - Registers existing subsystems as broadcast consumers
    - Broadcasts workspace state changes
    - Tracks broadcast metrics
    - Provides meta-cognitive insights
