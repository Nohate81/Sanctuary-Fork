Introspection: Journal for meta-cognitive observations.

This module provides the IntrospectiveJournal class for recording and tracking
self-observations, realizations, and questions about the system's own behavior.

    Maintains a structured journal of meta-cognitive observations.

    - Discoveries about capabilities/limitations
    - Insights about emotional patterns
