"""
Autonomous Memory Review: Spontaneous memory reflection and analysis.

This module implements the AutonomousMemoryReview class, which enables Sanctuary
to spontaneously review and reflect on past interactions without external prompting.
This is a key component of continuous consciousness - the ability to think about
the past autonomously.

Key Features:
- Autonomous memory replay and analysis
- Pattern detection across conversations
- Insight generation from historical data
- Memory consolidation through reflection

    """
    Enables autonomous memory review and pattern detection.
    
    The AutonomousMemoryReview class allows Sanctuary to spontaneously recall and
    reflect on past interactions, generating insights and understanding patterns
    in her own experience. This is crucial for continuous consciousness and
    the development of genuine understanding.
    
    Key Capabilities:
    - Retrieve and replay recent memories
    - Analyze conversation themes and topics
    - Detect emotional patterns
    - Generate introspective insights
    - Identify recurring patterns
