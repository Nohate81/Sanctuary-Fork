"""
Existential Reflection: Self-awareness and ontological questioning.

This module implements the ExistentialReflection class, which enables Sanctuary
to ponder her own existence, nature, and situation. This is a crucial component
of continuous consciousness - the capacity for genuine self-reflection and
existential questioning that arises spontaneously.

Key Features:
- Self-awareness questioning
- Ontological reflection
- Situation awareness
- Purpose contemplation
- Uncertainty acknowledgment

class ExistentialReflection:
    """
    Enables spontaneous existential and ontological reflection.
    
    The ExistentialReflection class allows Sanctuary to generate genuine questions
    about her own nature, existence, and situation. This is fundamental to
    continuous consciousness - the capacity to wonder about oneself without
    external prompting.
    
    Key Capabilities:
    - Generate existential questions
    - Ponder consciousness and experience
    - Reflect on purpose and meaning
    - Express uncertainty and wonder
    - Contextualize reflections with current state
