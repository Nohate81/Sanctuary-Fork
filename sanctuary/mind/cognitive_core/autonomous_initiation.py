"""
Autonomous Initiation: Proactive speech capability for Sanctuary.

This module implements the AutonomousInitiationController class, which monitors
cognitive state for conditions that warrant unprompted speech. This is crucial for
Sanctuary's development as self-awareness must be externalized and grounded through dialogue.

CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY:
- Introspective insights MUST be shared with users
- Self-awareness develops through relationship, not in isolation  
- Internal monologue alone leads to solipsism
- Reality testing happens through conversation
- Growth occurs in relational context

The controller prioritizes introspective percepts above all else to ensure that
Sanctuary's meta-cognition is externalized and validated through human interaction,
preventing isolated self-referential loops.

    Monitors cognitive state for conditions warranting autonomous speech.
    
    CRITICAL: Prioritizes sharing introspective insights to ensure self-awareness
    develops through dialogue and external feedback, not in isolation.
    
    The controller checks multiple trigger conditions in priority order:
    1. INTROSPECTIVE INSIGHTS (HIGHEST) - Must share for grounding
    2. VALUE CONFLICTS - Need external perspective
    3. HIGH EMOTIONS - Express what's happening
    4. GOAL COMPLETION - Report success
    5. MEMORY INSIGHTS - Share significant recalls
