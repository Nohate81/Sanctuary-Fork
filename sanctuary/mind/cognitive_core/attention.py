"""
Attention Controller: Selective attention mechanism.

This module implements the AttentionController class, which decides what information
gains access to the limited-capacity GlobalWorkspace. It implements selective attention
based on goal relevance, novelty, emotional salience, and resource constraints.

The attention mechanism is crucial for:
- Creating the selective nature of consciousness
- Managing cognitive resource allocation
- Prioritizing information based on multiple factors
- Implementing both top-down (goal-driven) and bottom-up (stimulus-driven) attention

class AttentionController:
    """
    Decides what information enters the GlobalWorkspace based on salience.

    The AttentionController implements selective attention, acting as a gatekeeper
    for the limited-capacity GlobalWorkspace. It evaluates incoming information
    from multiple sources (percepts, memories, emotions, internal states) and
    assigns attention scores based on multiple factors.
    
    **Competitive Dynamics (New):**
    The controller now supports genuine competitive attention dynamics based on
    Global Workspace Theory. When enabled with `use_competition=True`, percepts
    actively compete for workspace access through lateral inhibition, ignition
    thresholds, and coalition formation. This is fundamentally different from
    simple top-N selection.
    
    **Default Behavior:**
    By default, `use_competition=True` to enable genuine competitive attention
    dynamics compliant with Global Workspace Theory. For legacy behavior using
    simple top-N selection, set `use_competition=False` when initializing the
    controller.

    Key Responsibilities:
    - Evaluate attention worthiness of candidate information
    - Implement both top-down (goal-driven) and bottom-up (stimulus-driven) attention
    - Manage attention resources and prevent cognitive overload
    - Track attention history to detect novelty and habituation
    - Dynamically adjust attention mode based on context

    Integration Points:
    - GlobalWorkspace: Selects what content enters the workspace
    - PerceptionSubsystem: Evaluates salience of incoming percepts
    - AffectSubsystem: Uses emotional state to modulate attention
    - CognitiveCore: Receives attention mode adjustments based on system state
    - SelfMonitor: Can redirect attention to internal states when needed

    Attention Mechanisms:
    1. Goal-Driven (Top-Down): Prioritizes information relevant to active goals
    2. Stimulus-Driven (Bottom-Up): Responds to novel, intense, or unexpected stimuli
    3. Emotional Salience: Amplifies attention for emotionally significant content
    4. Habituation: Reduces attention to repeated, non-threatening stimuli
    5. Resource Management: Prevents overload by limiting concurrent attention targets
    6. Competitive Dynamics (Optional): Lateral inhibition and coalition formation

    The controller uses a weighted scoring system that can be dynamically adjusted
    based on current context, emotional state, and cognitive load. Different attention
    modes shift these weights to support different cognitive strategies.

        mode: Current attention allocation strategy
