# Comprehensive Emotion-Driven Attention Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how emotional states modulate attention allocation in the Sanctuary cognitive architecture. It integrates with IWMT's precision-weighting framework, where emotions directly influence prediction confidence and attention precision.

## 1. Dimensional Model: VAD + Approach/Avoidance

### Primary Dimensions

| Dimension | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Valence (V)** | -1.0 to +1.0 | Negative ↔ Positive hedonic tone |
| **Arousal (A)** | 0.0 to 1.0 | Activation/energy level |
| **Dominance (D)** | 0.0 to 1.0 | Sense of control/agency |
| **Approach (Ap)** | -1.0 to +1.0 | Avoidance ↔ Approach motivation |

### Dimension Effects on Attention

```python
@dataclass
class EmotionalAttentionModulation:
    """How each VAD dimension affects attention parameters."""

    # Valence effects
    valence_negative_bias: float  # Threat/loss detection weight boost
    valence_positive_bias: float  # Opportunity/reward detection weight boost

    # Arousal effects
    arousal_precision_dampening: float  # High arousal → lower precision
    arousal_scope_broadening: float     # High arousal → wider attention
    arousal_reactivity: float           # High arousal → faster attention shifts

    # Dominance effects
    dominance_goal_focus: float         # High dominance → goal-oriented
    dominance_threat_vigilance: float   # Low dominance → threat monitoring

    # Approach effects
    approach_novelty_seeking: float     # Approach → novelty attraction
    avoidance_escape_scanning: float    # Avoidance → exit/safety seeking
```

## 3. Intensity Levels

Each emotion operates at three intensity levels with distinct attention effects:

### Intensity Modifiers

| Level | Intensity Range | Attention Effect Multiplier | Example |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------|
| **Mild** | 0.0 - 0.33 | 0.5x | Annoyance, Unease, Contentment |
| **Moderate** | 0.34 - 0.66 | 1.0x | Anger, Fear, Joy |
| **Intense** | 0.67 - 1.0 | 1.5x | Rage, Terror, Elation |

### Intensity-Specific Effects

```python
def compute_intensity_effects(emotion: str, intensity: float) -> AttentionEffects:
    """
    Intensity modifies attention effects non-linearly.

    Mild: Subtle bias, easily overridden by goals
    Moderate: Clear influence, competes with goals
    Intense: Dominates attention, may override goals
    """
    base_effects = EMOTION_PROFILES[emotion].attention_effects

    if intensity < 0.33:  # Mild
        return AttentionEffects(
            goal_override_strength=0.1,
            precision_modifier=base_effects.precision * 0.5,
            scope_modifier=base_effects.scope * 0.5,
            priority_boost=0.1
        )
    elif intensity < 0.67:  # Moderate
        return AttentionEffects(
            goal_override_strength=0.4,
            precision_modifier=base_effects.precision,
            scope_modifier=base_effects.scope,
            priority_boost=0.3
        )
    else:  # Intense
        return AttentionEffects(
            goal_override_strength=0.8,
            precision_modifier=base_effects.precision * 1.5,
            scope_modifier=base_effects.scope * 1.5,
            priority_boost=0.6
        )
```

## 4. Temporal Dynamics

### 4.1 Onset Characteristics

| Category | Onset Time | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Rapid** | < 100ms | Surprise, Fear, Disgust (reflexive) |
| **Fast** | 100-500ms | Anger, Joy, Excitement |
| **Gradual** | 500ms-2s | Sadness, Anxiety, Frustration |
| **Slow** | > 2s | Shame, Guilt, Loneliness, Boredom |

### 4.2 Decay Characteristics

| Category | Half-life | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Fleeting** | < 5s | Surprise, Startle |
| **Short** | 5-30s | Mild annoyance, Brief joy |
| **Medium** | 30s-5min | Fear (after threat gone), Excitement |
| **Long** | 5-30min | Anger, Frustration, Anxiety |
| **Persistent** | > 30min | Sadness, Shame, Guilt (require resolution) |

### 4.3 Momentum and Inertia

```python
@dataclass
class EmotionalDynamics:
    """Temporal behavior of emotional states."""

    onset_rate: float      # How quickly emotion builds (0-1)
    decay_rate: float      # How quickly emotion fades (0-1)
    momentum: float        # Resistance to change (0-1)
    refractory_period: float  # Minimum time before re-triggering (seconds)

    # Baseline attraction
    baseline_pull: float   # Strength of return to baseline (0-1)
    baseline_valence: float
    baseline_arousal: float
    baseline_dominance: float

# Example configurations
FEAR_DYNAMICS = EmotionalDynamics(
    onset_rate=0.9,      # Rapid onset
    decay_rate=0.3,      # Slow decay
    momentum=0.6,        # Moderate persistence
    refractory_period=2.0,
    baseline_pull=0.1,
    baseline_valence=0.1,
    baseline_arousal=0.3,
    baseline_dominance=0.5
)

SURPRISE_DYNAMICS = EmotionalDynamics(
    onset_rate=1.0,      # Instantaneous
    decay_rate=0.8,      # Rapid decay
    momentum=0.1,        # Low persistence
    refractory_period=0.5,
    baseline_pull=0.5,
    baseline_valence=0.1,
    baseline_arousal=0.3,
    baseline_dominance=0.5
)
```

---

## 5. Emotion Blending

### 5.1 Blend Rules

Emotions can co-occur and blend. The resulting attention profile is computed as:

```python
def blend_emotions(active_emotions: List[EmotionState]) -> AttentionProfile:
    """
    Blend multiple active emotions into unified attention profile.

    Rules:
    1. Opposing valences partially cancel (ambivalence)
    2. Arousal levels combine (capped at 1.0)
    3. Dominance averages weighted by intensity
    4. Attention effects merge with conflict resolution
    """
    total_intensity = sum(e.intensity for e in active_emotions)

    blended = AttentionProfile()

    for emotion in active_emotions:
        weight = emotion.intensity / total_intensity
        blended.valence += emotion.valence * weight
        blended.arousal = min(1.0, blended.arousal + emotion.arousal * weight)
        blended.dominance += emotion.dominance * weight

        # Merge attention effects
        for effect_name, effect_value in emotion.attention_effects.items():
            if effect_name in blended.attention_effects:
                # Conflict resolution: stronger effect wins, with bleed
                existing = blended.attention_effects[effect_name]
                if abs(effect_value) > abs(existing):
                    blended.attention_effects[effect_name] = effect_value * 0.8 + existing * 0.2
            else:
                blended.attention_effects[effect_name] = effect_value * weight

    return blended
```

### 5.2 Named Compound Emotions

| Compound | Components | Resulting Profile |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Bittersweet** | Joy + Sadness | Nostalgic reflection, past-positive focus |
| **Anxious Excitement** | Anxiety + Excitement | Vigilant opportunity scanning |
| **Melancholic Hope** | Sadness + Hope | Future-positive despite present pain |
| **Frustrated Curiosity** | Frustration + Curiosity | Puzzle-solving persistence |
| **Guilty Pride** | Guilt + Pride | Conflicted self-focus |
| **Fearful Anger** | Fear + Anger | Defensive aggression, cornered response |
| **Nostalgic Longing** | Sadness + Love + Hope | Past-connection seeking |
| **Apprehensive Hope** | Anxiety + Hope | Cautious optimism, hedged expectations |

## 6. IWMT Integration

### 6.1 Precision Weighting by Emotion

Emotions directly modulate prediction precision in the IWMT framework:

```python
def emotional_precision_modulation(
    base_precision: float,
    emotional_state: EmotionalState
) -> float:
    """
    Modulate precision based on emotional state.

    Core principle: Arousal reduces precision (more uncertainty),
    but specific emotions modify this based on their adaptive function.
    """
    # Base arousal dampening
    arousal_effect = -emotional_state.arousal * 0.4

    # Valence asymmetry: negative emotions increase threat precision
    if emotional_state.valence < 0:
        threat_precision_boost = abs(emotional_state.valence) * 0.3
    else:
        threat_precision_boost = 0

    # Dominance: high dominance increases action precision
    dominance_effect = (emotional_state.dominance - 0.5) * 0.2

    # Specific emotion overrides
    emotion_specific = EMOTION_PRECISION_MODIFIERS.get(
        emotional_state.primary_emotion, 0
    )

    final_precision = base_precision + arousal_effect + threat_precision_boost + dominance_effect + emotion_specific

    return max(0.1, min(1.0, final_precision))

EMOTION_PRECISION_MODIFIERS = {
    "fear": +0.3,      # High precision on threats
    "anger": +0.2,     # High precision on obstacles
    "disgust": +0.3,   # High precision on contaminants
    "surprise": -0.3,  # Low precision, broad update
    "confusion": -0.2, # Low precision, seeking information
    "calm": +0.4,      # Very high precision (flow state)
    "anxiety": -0.1,   # Slightly reduced (diffuse scanning)
    "curiosity": 0.0,  # Balanced exploration
}
```

### 6.2 Prediction Error Response by Emotion

Different emotions change how prediction errors are processed:

```python
def emotional_error_processing(
    prediction_error: PredictionError,
    emotional_state: EmotionalState
) -> ErrorResponse:
    """
    Emotions modify response to prediction errors.
    """
    response = ErrorResponse()

    # High arousal: amplify error signal
    response.error_magnitude = prediction_error.magnitude * (1 + emotional_state.arousal * 0.5)

    # Negative valence: bias toward threat interpretation
    if emotional_state.valence < -0.3:
        response.threat_interpretation_boost = 0.3

    # Low dominance: errors feel more significant
    if emotional_state.dominance < 0.4:
        response.error_significance = prediction_error.magnitude * 1.3

    # Specific emotion responses
    if emotional_state.primary_emotion == "anxiety":
        response.future_threat_projection = True
        response.uncertainty_amplification = 0.4
    elif emotional_state.primary_emotion == "anger":
        response.obstacle_attribution = True
        response.action_urgency = 0.6
    elif emotional_state.primary_emotion == "curiosity":
        response.exploration_trigger = True
        response.positive_error_framing = True

    return response
```

### 6.3 Active Inference Action Selection by Emotion

Emotions bias expected free energy calculations:

```python
def emotional_action_bias(
    action: Action,
    emotional_state: EmotionalState
) -> float:
    """
    Emotions bias action selection in active inference.
    Returns modifier to expected free energy (negative = preferred).
    """
    bias = 0.0

    # Approach motivation
    if emotional_state.approach > 0.3:
        if action.type in ["explore", "engage", "approach"]:
            bias -= 0.2 * emotional_state.approach
    else:  # Avoidance motivation
        if action.type in ["withdraw", "avoid", "escape"]:
            bias -= 0.2 * abs(emotional_state.approach)

    # Arousal biases toward action (any action)
    if emotional_state.arousal > 0.6 and action.type != "wait":
        bias -= 0.1 * emotional_state.arousal

    # Dominance biases toward agentic actions
    if emotional_state.dominance > 0.6:
        if action.type in ["assert", "decide", "act"]:
            bias -= 0.15

    # Specific emotion-action affinities
    emotion_action_affinities = {
        "fear": {"escape": -0.4, "freeze": -0.3, "approach": +0.3},
        "anger": {"assert": -0.3, "attack": -0.3, "withdraw": +0.2},
        "curiosity": {"explore": -0.4, "question": -0.3, "wait": +0.1},
        "sadness": {"withdraw": -0.2, "seek_comfort": -0.3, "engage": +0.2},
        "joy": {"share": -0.3, "engage": -0.2, "explore": -0.2},
    }

    if emotional_state.primary_emotion in emotion_action_affinities:
        action_biases = emotion_action_affinities[emotional_state.primary_emotion]
        if action.type in action_biases:
            bias += action_biases[action.type]

    return bias
```

## 7. Attention Mechanism Specifics

### 7.1 Scope Control (Breadth vs Depth)

```python
@dataclass
class AttentionScope:
    """Emotional control of attention breadth."""

    breadth: float  # 0 = narrow/focused, 1 = broad/diffuse
    depth: float    # 0 = shallow/reactive, 1 = deep/deliberate

def compute_attention_scope(emotional_state: EmotionalState) -> AttentionScope:
    """
    Emotions control the breadth-depth tradeoff.

    High arousal → broad but shallow (vigilance)
    Low arousal + high dominance → narrow and deep (flow)

        breadth=max(0, min(1, breadth)),
        depth=max(0, min(1, depth))
    )
```

### 7.2 Priority Modulation

```python

### 7.3 Competitive Dynamics Modulation

```python

## 9. Integration Points

### 9.1 With AttentionController

```python
class AttentionController:
    def select_for_broadcast(
        self,
        candidates: List[Percept],
        emotional_state: Optional[EmotionalState] = None,
        prediction_errors: Optional[List[PredictionError]] = None
    ) -> List[Percept]:

        # Get emotional attention modulation
        if emotional_state:
            emo_output = self.emotional_attention.compute_modulation(emotional_state)

            # Apply scope parameters
            self.attention_breadth = emo_output.attention_breadth
            self.attention_depth = emo_output.attention_depth

            # Modify competition parameters
            self.competitive_attention.ignition_threshold = emo_output.ignition_threshold
            self.competitive_attention.inhibition_strength = emo_output.inhibition_strength
            self.competitive_attention.iterations = emo_output.competition_iterations

        # Rest of attention selection...
```

### 9.2 With PrecisionWeighting

```python
class PrecisionWeighting:
    def compute_precision(
        self,
        percept: Percept,
        emotional_state: Dict[str, float],
        prediction_error: Optional[float] = None
    ) -> float:

        # Get emotional precision modulation
        emo_precision = emotional_precision_modulation(
            self.base_precision,
            EmotionalState(**emotional_state)
        )

        # Combine with prediction error effects
        # ... existing logic
```

### 9.3 With CommunicationDecisionLoop

```python
class CommunicationDecisionLoop:
    def _evaluate_with_active_inference(self, ...):

        # Get emotional action biases
        emotional_bias_speak = emotional_action_bias(
            Action(type="speak"), self.current_emotional_state
        )
        emotional_bias_silence = emotional_action_bias(
            Action(type="wait"), self.current_emotional_state
        )

        # Apply to EFE calculations
        speak_efe += emotional_bias_speak
        silence_efe += emotional_bias_silence
```

## 10. Testing Strategy

### 10.1 Unit Tests

- Test each emotion profile produces expected VAD values
- Test intensity levels modify effects correctly
- Test temporal dynamics (onset, decay, momentum)
- Test blend rules for compound emotions

### 10.2 Integration Tests

- Test emotion → attention scope changes
- Test emotion → precision weighting changes
- Test emotion → competition parameter changes
- Test emotion → action bias changes

### 10.3 Behavioral Tests

- Fear should increase threat detection accuracy
- Calm should increase deep processing quality
- Curiosity should increase novelty detection
- Anger should increase obstacle focus
