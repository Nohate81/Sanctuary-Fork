"""
Subsystem health tracking and fault isolation.

Implements a supervisor pattern for cognitive subsystems. Each subsystem's
health is tracked independently — if one subsystem enters a failure loop,
it is temporarily disabled (circuit breaker opens) while the rest of the
cognitive loop continues operating normally.

Health states:
    HEALTHY     → Normal operation, no recent failures
    DEGRADED    → Experiencing intermittent failures, still attempting
    FAILED      → Circuit breaker open, subsystem skipped until recovery timeout
    RECOVERING  → Testing whether a failed subsystem has recovered
