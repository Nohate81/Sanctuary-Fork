"""Pydantic schemas for the cognitive cycle I/O protocol.

These models define the structured interface between the experiential core (LLM)
and the cognitive scaffold (Python subsystems). The LLM receives CognitiveInput
and produces CognitiveOutput each cycle. The schema IS the contract between
mind and body.
