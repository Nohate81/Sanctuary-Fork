"""
Tests for IncrementalJournalWriter and updated IntrospectiveJournal.

This test suite ensures that:
- Entries are written immediately, not batched
- Journal rotation works correctly
- File locking prevents concurrent writes
- Crash recovery is handled properly
- JSONL format is valid
- Compression works for archived journals
- Recent entries buffer is maintained
- Integration with IntrospectiveJournal works
