"""Sanctuary API — External interfaces.

Public API, CLI, and runner for interacting with the Sanctuary cognitive system.

Phase 6: Integration + Validation.

Imports are lazy to allow ``python -m sanctuary.api`` to work even when
optional heavy dependencies (torch, transformers, etc.) are not installed.
